                        <p>Since I was born, I have been processing information around me and learning as much as I possibly can. I'd say this is my superpower. Not only do I care about learning more, but I also seek it out. Although I have a small tech background, I am taking this course to learn more and practice my skills. I took a course that had some html and css built into the curriculum but we did not go much in depth. I am hoping this class will give me a good foundation for web development, and I hope to feel comfortable using coding languages and frameworks to build websites. I am also taking this course through Tech901 for the networking opportunities and connections it will hopefully bring. </p>
